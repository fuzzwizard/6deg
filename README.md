# 6 Degrees of Mungo Jerry

A lark of sorts.

To develop:

```bash
npm install && npm start
```

For production:

```bash
npm install && npm run build
# use the server of your choice
```

Buble is the transpiler and Rollup is the packer.

Built on [this excellent boilerplate](https://github.com/yamafaktory/buble-react-rollup-starter).
